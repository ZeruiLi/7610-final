# 7610 Final Project

This repository hosts my INFO 7610 final deliverable. The actual application lives under [`restaurant-recommender/`](./restaurant-recommender), while the original `hello-agents/` training materials are left on disk for reference only and are ignored by Git.

## Repository Layout
- `restaurant-recommender/` – standalone full-stack app (FastAPI backend + Vite/React frontend + evaluation scripts).
- `hello-agents/` – upstream tutorial repo used as a knowledge base (not part of the submission).
- `README.md` – this overview file.

Head into [`restaurant-recommender/README.md`](./restaurant-recommender/README.md) for setup instructions, architecture notes, and evaluation details.
